    <h3>About Me!</h3>
    <p>I am originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but my family moved to Colorado
        shortly after I came for school. I am majoring in journalism and double
        minoring in art practices and creative technology and design.
    </p>
    <p>My goals for this course are to have a better understanding of coding overall,
        and to be able to successfully create websites using code.</p>
