    <p><strong>Page 1</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>I added a closing table tab to the page below the table items and added a language 
            indicator to the starting html tag.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p><strong>Page 2</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>I fixed the closing bold tag on line 27 so it included /b.</li>
        <li>On line 53 the order of h2 tags and b tags is incorrect, so I changed it
            so that the bold tag was next to the text instead of the h2 tag.</li>
        <li>Line 57 contained hyperlinked text that did not have a proper URL, so in the code I 
            replaced the text with a Wikipedia page link.</li>
        <li>On line 74 there was an hr tag where a closing h6 tag should've been. To fix it I 
            replaced it with the correct closing tag. </li>
        <li>Finally I changed header sizes for the Description header, History header, and Closure header to match
            the others and added hr tags below the headers to also mirror the others.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p><strong>Page 3</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The page was missing a title, metadata, and the css stylesheet. I used the ! enter
            shortcut to get the basic metadata and title information correctly formatted, then
            I added a link to the css stylesheet into the head of the page using the link shortcut.</li> 
        <li>Finally, I went into the css file and changed the bottom value of the footer so that the 
            copyright line and box were in the correct position on the page.</li>    
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p><strong>Page 4</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The page was missing a docutype, so I included one at the very beginning of the page.</li>
        <li>I added an alt="" after each image link because they were all missing it.</li>
        <li>On line 47 there was an img tag in the quotations meant for the link, so to fix it I removed
            the img/ from the link.</li>
        <li>On line 38, 43, and 48 there were missing opening and closing td tags. I added a closing tag to line 38, 
            43 needed an opening tag, and 48 needed an opening tag.</li>
        <li>Finally I reordered the images so that they would line up correctly with their table category.</li>
    </ul>
